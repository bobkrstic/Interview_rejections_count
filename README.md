This is a React/Firebase Auth project.

User will be able to sign up, and signin to their account to a simple Home Page application.

The work is in progress. Sign up and Sign in logic is completed.

The idea is to have the "count" functionality. Simple logic, boiler plate for future projects that will need authorization process with the database.
